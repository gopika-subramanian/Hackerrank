#r_Print It test case basics

You will learn how to handle test cases.

Test case: for any problem, a test case is one set of input for which expected output is generated by your program.

In coding problems (almost all), your code is expected to pass a set of testcases. A simple problem of printing hello is used to help you understand this concept.

Given an integer N. The task is to print "Hello" N times.


You will learn:
- - how to read and use test cases in coding problems
- - to use loops.

Input Format

The first line contains a single integer T i.e. the number of test cases.
Each test case contains a single integer N representing number of times the string "Hello" will be printed.

Ex: 2 <-- Number of test cases (first read of input will read this value into your program) 1 <-- Number of times "Hello" string will be printed, test case 1 2 <-- Number of times "Hello" string will be printed, test case 2

Constraints

1 <=T <= 20 1 <= N <= 100

Output Format

Corresponding to each test case, print "Hello" N times (without quotes), every time on a new line.

Sample Input 0

2
3
2
Sample Output 0

Hello

Hello
Hello
Hello
Explanation 0

Number of test cases was 2. First n is 3 so we printed Hello 3 times. First n is 2 so we printed Hello 2 times.
