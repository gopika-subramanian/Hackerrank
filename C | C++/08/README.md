# b_Smallest subarray with sum greater than x

Given an array of integers (A[]) and a number x, find the smallest subarray with sum greater than the given value.

Hint: Use sliding window technique and solve this problem with O(N) time complexity please

Please understand how "Sliding Window Technique" code works, at above link. View the video link mentioned in the google sheet having practice links.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated integers N and x. Then in the next line are N space separated values of the array.

## Constraints

1<=T<=100 1<=N,x<=1000 1<=A[]<=1000

## Output Format

For each test case in a new line print the required ouput.

## Sample Input 0

1
6 51
1 4 45 6 0 19

## Sample Output 0
