Company Q; Amazon

Given a boolean matrix mat[M][N] of size M X N, modify it such that if a matrix cell mat[i][j] is 1 (or true) then make all the cells of ith row and jth column as 1.

## Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The first line of each test case is r and c, r is the number of rows and c is the number of columns. The second line of each test case contains all the elements of the matrix in a single line separated by a single space.

## Constraints

1 ≤ T ≤ 100 1 ≤ r, c ≤ 1000 0 ≤ A[i][j] ≤ 1

## Output Format

Print the modified array.
